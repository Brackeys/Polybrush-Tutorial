- When blending multiple brushes in texture mode use the max weight instead of summing.
- Add information about setting shader paths to Hidden in Shaderforge instructions.
- In vertex sculpting modes iterate per-common index instead of per-vertex, improving brush application performance and minimizing chances of splitting a common vertex by accident.
- Minor cleanup of enum types (make sure they're namespaced & remove unused includes).
- Fix bug where script reloads would null-ify texture mode brush color and not properly reset it.
- Fix errors in brush event logic that caused OnBrushEnter/Move/Exit to be called at incorrect times with invalid targets, resulting in crashes when editing prefabs with multiple meshes with different shaders
- Fix undo throwing errors when splat_cache is null.
- Clamp radius max value to min+.001 to avoid crashes when scrolling radius shortcut with equal min/max values.
- Fix uv3/4 not applying or applying to incorrect mesh channels in ProBuilder (requires update to ProBuilder 2.5.1).
- Fix null errors when sculpting pb_Object meshes caused by FinalizeAndResetHovering iterating the same object multiple times.

## Changes

- Set default brush settings radius max to 5.
- When blending multiple brush effects use lighten blending mode instead of additive.
- Shorten ShaderForge source file suffix to "_SfSrc" (but keep compatibility for older "_SfTexBlendSrc").

- Split Direction *Normal* into *Brush Normal* and *Vertex Normal*.
- Improve the behavior of Smooth Mode.

- When dragging, always restrict brush application to the current selection.

## Bug Fixes

- Make sure that the Texture Paint mode always has valid splat-weights to work with (usually causing "black face errors").

- Fix instances where setting ProBuilder edit level would not correctly unset Polybrush tool (and vice-versa).

## Changes

- Standard Vertex Color and Standard Texture Blend shaders now default to metallic / roughness workflow.

Initial Release.
